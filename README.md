We built an ag-themed networking website for hiring and applying for jobs in the agriculture space. In an ideal environment, this would be a private website that you can access only after have networked at an agriculture related event from a hiring manager or recruiter. This is an easier way to apply and move applicants along in the hiring process, rather than the standard way of applying for jobs online, which is more or less <i><b>painful</b></i>.

We started with thinking of landing pages, aka home pages. These home pages are:
- <a href="https://github.com/TateSamuD/HackISUv2_TNT/blob/main/index_applicant.html">index_applicant.html</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/TateSamuD/HackISUv2_TNT/blob/main/index_company.html">index_company.html</a>

The NavBar is viewable on the following screens for their respective users:
- <a href="https://github.com/TateSamuD/HackISUv2_TNT/blob/main/tab_profile.html">Profile</a> (Applicants user)
- <a href="https://github.com/TateSamuD/HackISUv2_TNT/blob/main/tab_company.html">Companies</a> (Applicants user) 
- <a href="https://github.com/TateSamuD/HackISUv2_TNT/blob/main/tab_applicant.html">Applicants</a> (Companies user)
- Home (both users, the index files above)

_________________
<h3>There are two users for our website: Applicants and Companies. </h3>

Each of these users has their own login page, after the initial website landing page asks "What type of user are you?" The user then selects Applicants or Companies, which leads them to their respective login pages. For 24hr timesake, we did not do a registration page.

- Applicants can upload their resumes (PDF) on their profile and update their information under the "Profile" tab. They can view companies to quick apply to under the "Companies" tab.

- Companies can view the home page and the Applicants tab, which shows student profiles and resumes. Ideally, we would have made a company profile tab for companies to edit info about their company if we had more time.

<h3> Revenue Model </h3>

We pitched the idea that Agriculture companies looking to hire the best appicants (that know how network well), would help sponsor and launch the website.
