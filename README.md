# HackISUv2
 
<h3>Welcome, this our project for HackISUv2!</h3>

The theme for this hackathon is: Agriculture

Team name: TNT

Team members:

We are building an ag-themed website for hiring and applying for jobs in the agriculture space. We wanted to focus on networking. In an ideal environment, this would be a private website that you can access only after have networked at an agriculture related event from a hiring manager or recruiter. This is an easier way to apply and hire, rather than the standard way of applying for jobs.

We started with thinking of landing pages, aka home pages. These home pages are:
    index_applicant.html
    index_company.html

There are two users for our website: Applicants and Companies.
